### PL-MATCHDAY-RESULTS

A small utility application that I created for my own personal use. I wanted a way to know about the results for each match day in the Premier League, but did NOT want to know about the score, details, or match events. I couldn't find any application that provided me with this service. The application uses livescore.com's public API to fetch the CURRENT match day data and then shows only the winning team for each match (or whether if the result is a draw).

#### Getting started

To get the project running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start the local server
